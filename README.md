# Summer Internship at Multilynx
## Concepts covered so far:
1) OOP and its 4 pillars
2) Design Patterns
3) Figma
4) PhpMyAdmin ------> Made complete mini CRUD system using just PHP and MySQL. It connects to the database, allows to add, update, and delete records, and displays them all dynamically. I’ve used GET for editing and deleting, and POST for submitting form data. I also implemented logic to reload the page after each operation so users don’t accidentally repeat an action.

5) Database Work with design patterns-------> I applied 4 different design patterns to make mini CRUD system project clean, scalable, and modular. Singleton ensures efficient DB use, Factory method handles object creation, Observer notifies when employees are added, and Decorator extends display behavior. Together, these patterns demonstrate my understanding of both OOP and good design practices.
